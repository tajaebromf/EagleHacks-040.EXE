Sentinel Fleet is a program designed to enhance Hertz's response to natural disasters by ensuring vehicle availability in affected regions. The idea was inspired by a firsthand experience during Hurricane Ian when one of our team members was unable to secure a rental car due to Hertz running out of vehicles.

Our solution establishes main hubs located outside disaster-prone areas, where a large fleet of vehicles is stored. Once the disaster has passed, these hubs deploy cars to impacted regions, ensuring Hertz maintains a consistent supply.

The program facilitates vehicle transfers by allowing main hubs to request cars from regions unaffected by the disaster that have an excess supply. A centralized database provides real-time availability, enabling efficient allocation and distribution of vehicles across different locations.

By implementing Sentinel Fleet, Hertz can improve disaster preparedness and maintain uninterrupted service for customers in times of crisis.
